	* PeerIdInternal.cs: Hack-fix: In some cases it can take up to 190
	  seconds for a pending connection request to time out. Force the
	  connection attempt to abort after 10 seconds if it is not
	  successful.

	* PeerId.cs: Expose the IConnection through the PeerId so custom connections
	  can match a PeerId to an IConnection

	* PeerId.cs: Added close connection method.
