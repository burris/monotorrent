Build instructions:
Windows:
Run the "VS2005.bat" file in the buildscripts folder in order to generate the 
standard Visual Studio project files. Then just use them as normal

Linux/Mac OS X:
Enter the source folder, then run: ./configure; make; make install;

This will compile monotorrent and install it into $PREFIX (defaults to /usr/local).
To run the sample client you just have to run "monotorrent". Note, this assumes
that your prefix is in your $PATH.


More instructions can be found in the second readme file found in src/README.

I will be consolidating documentation soon and this readme will vanish ;)
